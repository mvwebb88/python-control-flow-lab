# Python Control Flow Lab

## Overview

This lab introduces **control flow in Python** for developers with a JavaScript background.  
It focuses on writing interactive programs that make decisions, repeat actions, and safely handle user input.

The exercises are designed to help reinforce Python syntax while drawing clear parallels to JavaScript concepts.
